# PS-Conference Application

## Description
A simple Spring Boot application that demonstrates fundamental features of Spring Boot, including dependency injection, JPA for database management, and RESTful APIs.

## Features
- Basic CRUD functionality (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
- REST API to interact with the backend.
- Spring Data JPA integration with PostgreSQL.
- Maven for dependency management and build automation.

## Architecture: MVC (Model-View-Controller)
The project follows the **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** architecture, a design pattern for structuring Spring Boot applications. This architecture ensures the application is organized, maintainable, and scalable, with clear divisions of responsibility for handling data, user interaction, and business logic.

## Technologies Used
- **Spring Boot** for application setup and framework.
- **Java JDK 17** for language support.
- **Spring Data JPA** for database interaction.
- **PostgreSQL** for data persistence.
- **Maven** for managing dependencies and building the project.

## API Endpoints
- CRUD endpoints for managing entities.

## Testing
For testing the API, **Postman** was used to simulate HTTP requests. Endpoints were tested by sending GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests to ensure proper functionality.
